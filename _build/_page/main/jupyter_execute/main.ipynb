    "# Preamble\n",
    "If your posts contain lots of math along with code (e.g. writing about a new machine learning or robotics research paper), you may find this post useful. On the other hand, if your posts are mostly about code (e.g. writing about how to use an existing package / library), this post may be overkill for you. Okay, let's get started.\n",

    "The beautiful and powerful [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/overview.html) ecosystem is meant for writing online books with publication quality content. However, we will be using this ecosystem to write a short blog post, a.k.a. *an article* in Jupyter Book parlance. Jupyter book offers tremendous functionality and flexibility, but we will focus on getting up-and-running quickly by creating a post from a single markdown file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup\n",
    "Following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each blog post (or article) must have its own directory, referred to as the project root directory. This root directory will eventually be turned into a github repository. If you intend to write multiple posts, it may be a good idea to create a parent directory to conain all your project root direrctories.\n",
